**Project Role:
Implemented a TensorFlow-based image classification project for tomato disease identification.
Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to accurately classify tomato diseases.
Applied TensorFlow for data preprocessing, including resizing, rescaling, and augmentation.
Partitioned datasets into training, validation, and test sets using TensorFlow pipelines.
Trained the model using TensorFlow's Keras API, optimizing with Adam optimizer and evaluating metrics like accuracy and loss.
Deployed the model using TensorFlow's SavedModel format and integrated a Gradio interface for real-time predictions.

**Outcomes:**
Achieved high accuracy in classifying tomato diseases, contributing to agricultural disease management and crop health monitoring.
Implemented interactive features with Gradio for user-friendly model interaction and validation of real-world performance.
Demonstrated expertise in deep learning, TensorFlow, and model deployment for practical agricultural applications.
